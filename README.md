# Medical Image Processing Course

This repository contains Python scripts developed as part of my **integrated master's degree (Biomedical Engineering) coursework in Medical Image Processing**.  
Each script corresponds to a class exercise demonstrating key image processing concepts from simple display and gray-level transformations to frequency-domain filtering, image enhancement, and edge detection.

| Class | Script | Topic | Description |
|:------|:--------|:------|:-------------|
| **Class 1** | `image_display_transformations.py` | Image Display & Normalization | Demonstrates basic image display techniques including simple linear mapping, optimal min-max normalization, custom threshold mapping, and random threshold display. Works with both small matrices and real images (BMP, JPG, PNG, DICOM). |
| **Class 2** | `image_display_windowing.py`  | Advanced Display & Windowing | Implements advanced image display methods including linear mapping, simple/broken/double windowing, and nonlinear transformations (inverse, logarithmic, power, sine, exponential, sigmoid, cosine). Works with both small matrices and real images (BMP, JPG, PNG, DICOM). |
| **Class 3** | `histogram_equalization_demo.py` | Histogram Equalization & Windowing | Implements linear and nonlinear window functions, and multiple histogram equalization methods (CDF, CLAHE, OpenCV). |
| **Class 4** | `spatial_domain_filtering.py` | Image Enhancement & Filtering | Demonstrates smoothing, Laplacian, high-emphasis, and median filtering for contrast and detail enhancement. |
| **Class 5** | `frequency_domain_filtering.py` | Frequency Domain Restoration & Filtering | Applies Butterworth, Gaussian, and Exponential filters in the frequency domain, and performs image restoration using inverse, Wiener, and Richardson–Lucy deconvolution. |
| **Class 6** | `tomographic_reconstruction.py` | Tomographic Reconstruction | Implements Radon transform to generate sinograms, reconstructs images using Filtered Back Projection (FBP) and Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART), and evaluates reconstruction quality using structural error analysis. |

## Learning Objectives

This collection of scripts covers fundamental topics in **Image Processing**, including:

- Grayscale and color image handling  
- Spatial and frequency domain operations  
- Image filtering and enhancement  
- Histogram-based methods  
- Edge detection and feature extraction  
- Morphological transformations  

These exercises form a foundation for more advanced applications in  **computer vision**, and **image analysis**.
